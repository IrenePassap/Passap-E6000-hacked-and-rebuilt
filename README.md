# Passap E 6000 Console, Reverse-Engineering
# Passap Electra 4600: Motor and controller rebuilt

Passap E6000 Project; 
Author: IrenePassap; 
version 20.6.2020, update 20.6.21 for Passap E6000, programm code for Electra 4600 and Raspberry Pi 3B (Debian Buster)


The programs are written for the Passap E6000 knitting machine and the Electra 4600 engine. There are four programs, one for the front lock (Arduino M0), one for the rear lock (Arduino M0), one for the motor and one for the Raspberry Pi 3.

Feel free to use the program codes for your project. The programs work perfectly for my knitting machine. It also lacks features of the original Passap console. The programs are only intended to give you an idea for your own project.

I assume that you can not just take over the programs for your knitting machine. You probably have to make adjustments.

The program codes are partially commented. Most methods or variable names are self-explanatory.

- Passap front lock arduino program code: This program code is for the front lock. 

- Passap rear lock arduino program code: The program code for the rear lock has the same structure as the program code for the front  lock. It should be noted, however, that the rear lock is mirrored, so the variables must be adjusted.

- Passap Electra 4600 motor programm code, update 20.6.21 version 6

- Raspberry Pi 3 programm code --> update 23.7.21

Without the work of Hackerspace-Bamberg I would never have been able to realize this project. See https://github.com/knitty/firmware; https://www.hackerspace-bamberg.de/Passap_pfaff_e6000
